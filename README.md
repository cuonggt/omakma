# Omakma

An opinionated Omakase Developer Setup for macOS Sonoma 14.5 and newer heavily inspired by [Omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub). Turn a fresh macOS installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system by running a single command.

## Installation

With your fresh macOS installation done, open the Terminal app and enter:

```
bash < <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cuonggt/omakma/master/boot.sh)
```

This will start the installation process. It's almost entirely automated.
